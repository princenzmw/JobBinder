# JobBinder: Connecting Careers

_Discover your future with a click._

## Description

**JobBinder** is designed to streamline the job search and application process by offering a user-friendly platform that connects `job seekers` with `potential employers`. The platform aims to resolve the disconnect between the numerous available positions and the job-hunting community, which struggles to find suitable employment.

This project is globally relevant, as it uses internet accessibility to bridge the gaps in the job market and is not dependent on a specific locale.

It is designed as the final project for the `ALX foundation` phase (`Portfolio project`).
